# Gourd-Yuhaya

Recorded Gourdflute instrument samples (played by Yuhaya Wu 吳瑜駿).

We finally decided to make only 24bit-48kHz version available to the public. Reasons:

1. The samples are all originally recorded in 24bit-96kHz. However, frequencies higher than 24kHz are meaningless for storing effective audio information of this instrument.

2. Sample conversions (from 48kHz to 44100Hz) shouldn't bring troublematic performance problems while performing on today's computer hardwares.

We offer instrument formats for Sforzando, Presence XT and Kontakt (at least 5.6.6 R16, not the Kontakt Player but the full version). **All samples are precisely processed with sufficient noise destruction.**

It is fine to use all materials **FOR FREE** from this repository for either commercial or non-commercial **music production purposes only**.

This product is released under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Things need to beware:

- You should not sell these samples to others, because these are not yours.

- If you make these samples into virtual instruments, the virtual instrument must not be sold to others (due to the same reason above). Plus, you must credit that these samples are recorded from Yuhaya Wu 吳瑜駿's performance.

- You may ask for paid services to improve the quality of the virtual instrument you are using (e.g. Kontakt scripting). In such case, you have the responsibility not to leak the virtual instrument file to the public UNLESS the involved programmer(s) treat his/her/their work voluntary.

### Update History

#### [2017APR24] v1.01

- Using 24bit-48kHz in lieu of 24bit-96kHz to save some disk space occupation from useless frequencies.
- All samples are now precisely tuned (by using a free app called Polyphone, with manual corrections necessary).
- Every sample are now processed with Audacity to make sure all unwanted noises are cleaned.
- Kontakt patch is now made in monolith, due to reduced size of audio files. This won't significantly reduce its loading speed in Kontakt.
